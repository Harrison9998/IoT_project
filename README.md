# My Python Project

This project is designed to monitor temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor. It displays the readings on an SSD1306 OLED screen and provides alerts when the temperature exceeds a specified threshold.

## Files

- **期末專案.py**: The main script that handles sensor readings, displays data on the OLED screen, and manages alerts based on temperature and humidity.
- **font_HunInn.py**: Contains font data for rendering Chinese characters on the OLED display.
- **ssd1306.py**: Driver code for the SSD1306 OLED display, providing functions to initialize and control the display.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-python-project
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start monitoring temperature and humidity:
```
python 期末專案.py
```

Ensure that the DHT11 sensor is connected properly and the OLED display is functioning.
